/*
Create two classes, Person and Student, to model individuals and their behaviours. Implement properties and methods to display personalized messages about their identity and academic details. Implement the classes within the main function as demonstrated in the starter code provided.

1. Create a class called Person with the following properties and methods.

Properties:-
name (string)
age (number)
gender (string)

Methods:
speak() - logs a message to the console saying "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

Constructor:
Include a constructor in the class that accepts name, age, and gender as arguments and initializes the corresponding properties.


2. Create a class called Student with the following properties and methods:

Properties:
person (object)
major (string)
gpa (number)

Methods:
study() - logs a message to the console saying "I am studying [major] and my GPA is [gpa]."
speak() - logs a message to the console saying "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old. I am also a student studying [major]."

Constructor:
Include a constructor in the Student class that accepts a Person object, major, and gpa as arguments. It should initialize the person property with the provided Person object and assign the given values to major and gpa.


Expected Input:-

const person1 = new Person("John",20,"M");
person1.speak();
const stud1 = new Student(person1,"CS",9);
stud1.speak();
stud1.study();


Expected Output:-

Hello, my name is John and I am 20 years old.
Hello, my name is John and I am 20 years old. I am also a student studying CS.
I am studying CS and my GPA is 9.


Hint:
The Student class has a person property, which is an object of the Person class. To access the name and age of the student, you should use this.person.name and this.person.age.

    class Student{
        person;
        major;
        gpa;
        constructor(person, major, gpa) {
            this.person = person;
            this.major = major;
            this.gpa = gpa;
        }
