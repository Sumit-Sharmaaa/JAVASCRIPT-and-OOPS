// OOPS in jS

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Classes & Instances
4. Encapsulation
5. Abstraction


We have already seen and used Inheritance and Polymorphism in some of our eg while Learning.
Now, we'll see the the Rest.

* Classes in JS -> 
Earlier in initial version of JS there was no concept of classes, and objects were created using Constructors
and object Literals, but later it was introduced to make it sync with other programming Languages but,
in JS classes actually doesnt work like how it works in other programming Languages.

So classes in js is basically syntactic Sugar over Constructor Function.
Everything works same like prototypal inheritance, scope etc. only the creation part is changed
